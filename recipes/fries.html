        <p class="content">Skip the drive-thru and make irresistible seasoned fries at home. This seasoned French fry recipe creates fries that are crispy on the outside, but fluffy and tender on the inside. </p>
        <h2 class="heading">Ingredients</h2>
        <ul class="content">
            <li>2 and a half pounds russet potatoes, peeled</li>
            <li>1 cup vegeteable oil for frying</li>
            <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tsp garlic salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp onion salt</li>
            <li>1 tsp paprika</li>
            <li>1 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1 and a half cup water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h2 class="heading">Steps</h2>
        <ol class="content">
            <li>Slice potatoes into French fries and place them into a large bowl of cold water to prevent them from turning brown.</li>
            <li>Heat oil in a heavy saucepan or large skillet to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
            <li>While the oil is heating, sift flour, garlic salt, onion salt, paprika, and salt into a large bowl. Gradually stir in enough water to make a slightly thick batter that can be drizzled from a spoon.</li>
            <li>Drain fries and pat dry; dip into the batter one at a time.</li>
            <li>Lower fries carefully into the hot oil in batches to prevent them from clumping together. Fry until golden brown and crispy on all sides, about 7 to 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>Drain fries on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
        </ol>
